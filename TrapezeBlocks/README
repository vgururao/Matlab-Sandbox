This is the code from the final project for the a complex systems modeling course I taught at Cornell in 2006. It is a domain testbed for AI/OR/Controls experimentation called "Trapeze Blocks."

It is a mashup of the classic AI model known as Blocks World, along with swinging pendulum dynamics that are a classic problem in control theory.

If you want to play with the code/project in Matlab, read the finalproject.doc document for an introduction to the code.
