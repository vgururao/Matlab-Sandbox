I write this set of scripts to support an end-term assignment I created for a 2006 class on modeling of complex systems that I taught at Cornell. The point was to provide a testbed on which to try out planning, scheduling and control algorithms. 

The code sets up stacked blocks and a set of 3 cranes that move the blocks around. There is support for both non-dynamic movement and dynamic (swinging pendulum) movement. 

It was partly inspired by the blocks world model used in AI and partly by container handling cranes and the classic pendulum model used in control theory (though not inverted).

Run blocksdaemon.m in Matlab to initialize a blocksworld scene.

I'll add more documentation soon.
