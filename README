Some fun scripts  and mini-projects from over the years. I've written over the years for school (both teaching and learning) or work.

Each folder is a mini-project, sometimes with just one file.

Current contents:

1. Trapeze Blocks: a simulation domain that's kinda like a container shipping yard.

2. Planes: simple visualization code for multiple UAVs flying around.

3. Fog of War: the simulation mentioned in Tempo.
