Divergentism is the idea that as individuals grow out into the universe, they diverge from each other in thought-space. This, I argued, is true even if in absolute terms, the sum of shared beliefs is steadily increasing. Because the sum of beliefs that are not shared increases even faster on average. Unfortunately, you are unique, just like everybody else.

If you are a divergentist, you believe that as you age, the average answer to the fundamental Verizon question slowly drifts, as you age, from yes, to no, to silence. If you’re unlucky, you’re a hedgehog and get unhappier and unhappier about this as you age. If you are lucky, you’re a fox and you increasingly make your peace with this condition. If you’re really lucky, you die too early to notice the slowly descending silence, before it even becomes necessary to Google the phrase existential horror.

To me, this seemed like a completely obvious idea. Much to my delight, most people I ran it by immediately hated it.


Most people are convergentists by default. They believe that if reasonable people share an increasing number of explicit beliefs, they must necessarily converge to similar conclusions about most things. A more romantic version rests on the notion of continuously deepening relationships based on unspoken bonds between people. Bonds that allow them to finish each other’s Medium posts, and enjoy companionable soul-meld silences.

Convergentism is the basis of all politics. Liberal politics exhibits convergentist thinking particularly strongly. This is partly why liberals attempt to bridge political divides by earnestly trying to increase the raw quantity of shared priors, sincerely believing that every new shared belief (based in Science! preferably) brings people closer together. Conservative politics is convergentist too, but via pre-emptive silencing of no, I cannot hear you links, and energetic attempts to turn shallow verbalized bonds into deeper unspoken bonds that are always on, always at yes.
