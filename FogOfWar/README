This is the "Fog of War" simulation mentioned in Tempo.

The video of the simulation is at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIRzm7cYvLU 

The code is hiersim.m

At the moment it doesn't appear to be working, but feel free to hack at it.

The explanation (technical) is in this paper, in the hierarchical abstraction section in the file chapter17.pdf
